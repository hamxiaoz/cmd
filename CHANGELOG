== Version 0.7.2

* Breaking the assignment to READLINE_SUPPORTED over multiple lines did not
  appease RDoc. Fortunately Dave Thomas showed me several ways that I could
  accomplish the same thing whilst appeasing RDoc. Sadly another minor bug fix
  release :\ [Dave Thomas]

== Version 0.7.1 

* Broke assignment to READLINE_SUPPORTED over several lines as removing the
  semicolons resulted in the incorrect behavior, and having the semicolons made
  RDoc fail to parse the file. [Jim Weirich]

== Version 0.7.0 

* Initial public release
